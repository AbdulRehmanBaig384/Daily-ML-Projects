<h1># Daily-ML-Projects</h1>  

This repository is a **daily log of my Machine Learning practice**.  
Every day, I work on small datasets to explore concepts of data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.  

---

## 📌 Objectives  
- Build hands-on experience with Machine Learning and Data Science workflows  
- Practice **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** using popular datasets (Iris, Titanic, Flights, Placement, etc.)  
- Implement ML algorithms using `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and other libraries  
- Develop a strong foundation in **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**  
- Improve problem-solving and analytical skills by applying ML on real-world datasets  

---

## 📊 Current Progress  
- **Bivariant Analysis** → EDA on Flights, Iris, Titanic and other datasets  
- **Placement Prediction** → Training ML models on student placement dataset  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning with `pandas` and `numpy`  
- Model building and evaluation using `scikit-learn`  

---

## 📚 Upcoming Topics  
As I progress, this repository will also include:  
- Advanced feature engineering  
- Model optimization & hyperparameter tuning  
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- Deep Learning basics (with `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch`)  
- End-to-end ML projects with deployment  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Mlxtend  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub
